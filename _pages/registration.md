Based on longstanding prior ACL practice, all papers in the program (oral or poster) must have the actual presenter of each paper registered for the conference at the appropriate rate for their intended presentation modality and status (e.g. virtual or in-person, student or regular, full conference or workshop only). Also, all in-person attendees must register for the conference at the in-person rates, and virtual (Underline platform) credentials should not be shared.

Thus all virtual presenters should also be registered individually (at student or regular rates, as appropriate). Findings papers only appearing in the proceedings need not have someone register, but Findings papers presented in any way, including as virtual posters or spotlight talks, should register at the appropriate in-person or virtual rate of the presenter. If an attendee's or actual presenter's registration status changes after registration (e.g. from in-person to virtual, or virtual to in-person, or if the actual presenter changes) then a partial refund or additional payment may be made as appropriate.  If any of the above would cause financial hardship, please apply for D&I subsidies including discounted or free virtual registration. Application Link will be available October 9, 2023.

## In- Person Pricing

## Membership Policy & Fees 
The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2023) ACL member. So, in addition to the registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2023 paid member. Your ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.






## Cancelation Policy  
Cancellation of registration one month or more prior to the conference (November 07, 2023, or before), will be refunded the full amount paid. (Minus up to $50 processing fee)
Cancellations up to three weeks prior to the conference (Nov 16, 2023) will be refunded the ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200. Cancellations 2 weeks prior to start of Conference (November 23, 2023), and all no-shows, will not be refunded any amount. They will be able to retain the current full year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and have access virtually.

Exceptions: Cancellation due to governmental travel restrictions, unstable situation of countries like a war, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness that prevents travel to the conference will be refunded the full amount paid or the difference between the in-person and virtual registration fees in case virtual attendance is still possible (Minus up to $50 processing fee) regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office and must submit documentation supporting or explaining the above cancelation exceptions.
