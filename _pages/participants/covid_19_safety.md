It is the policy of ACL conferences that attendees wear high-quality, well-fitting masks while attending indoor functions at ACL events, removing their masks only the minimal amount necessary to eat and drink. This policy is in force even if local regulations are less strict, but may be superseded by stricter local regulations.

Furthermore, the ACL strongly encourages attendees to be cautious with masking in indoor space outside the conference venue (e.g. on public transit or while eating away from the venue) to avoid bringing COVID to the venue. This policy will be revisited annually by the ACL exec so as to be responsive to changing pandemic conditions.

## Staying safe while attending EMNLP 2022 in personPermalink

This is essential information for anyone who will be present at our conference.

### Before you leave

We strongly encourage all participants to test before travelling to the conference and you should not travel if your test is positive.

Please ensure that you have checked with your airline to understand their policies regarding COVID-19 and have adequate travel insurance in place.

Please ensure you have taken the time to read all of the latest [advice about travel to Abu Dhabi](https://visitabudhabi.ae/en/plan-your-trip/covid-safe-travel).

### At the conference

Some advice on COVID-19 restrictions is given, please visit [here](https://visitabudhabi.ae/en/plan-your-trip/covid-safe-travel) for more detail before you start your trip.

However, to ensure everyone's safety, and with the purpose of making everyone comfortable at the conference, please carefully consider the following if you are attending in person:

* It is the policy of ACL conferences that attendees wear high-quality, well-fitting masks while attending indoor functions at ACL events, removing their masks only the minimal amount necessary to eat and drink.

* The ACL strongly encourages attendees to be cautious with masking in indoor space outside the conference venue (e.g., on public transit or while eating away from the venue) to avoid bringing COVID to the venue.

* As a precaution we have minimized the number of plenary events, and we will have only one plenary event each day.

* If you start to feel ill or test positive during the conference, please leave the venue immediately, and do not come to the venue anymore.

* We will also have a point of contact (TBD) that people can report positive cases to and consult with.

* To avoid crowded situations, we recommend making optimal use of the available spaces, particularly during coffee breaks.

* Speakers and session chairs are not required to wear masks while presenting, as there is enough distance between speakers and audience.

We come from different countries and different personal experiences about COVID-19, and for many of us EMNLP 2022 is the first hybrid conference after the peaks of the pandemic. In order to favor interpersonal relations, we will use a ''traffic light system'' with stickers to attach to your badge to indicate your feelings on social distancing:

* Red: keep a distance

* Amber: being cautious, no touching

* Green: handshakes and hugs ok

### Plan ahead to return home

Please ensure you know the COVID-19 testing requirements for return travel back into your country of origin. The requirements are available on your Government website.
