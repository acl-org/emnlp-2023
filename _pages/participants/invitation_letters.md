A letter of invitation will be issued once you register for the EMNLP 23 Conference through YesEvents and can be printed for your travel. 


Participants from some Countries will need an additional Visa [V39A form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/101n0IyxzeS53HbcElWBqwbprS45MMH3Z/view). The ACL has designated CMA International Consultants to assist in the issuance of V39A form to support visa application.
