## Code of Conduct

By registering, participants acknowledge and agree to follow the [ACL's code of ethics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics), the [ACL's anti-harassment policy](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Anti-Harassment_Policy), and the ACL code of conduct below. Violations against those should be reported to the [Professional Conduct Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Professional_Conduct_Committee) by approaching any of its members. The contact information for each member and the languages they speak are listed [here](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Professional_Conduct_Committee).

## ACL Code of Conduct

The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of the ACL. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.

Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person's participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.

It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the [Professional Conduct Committee](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Professional_Conduct_Committee). Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.
