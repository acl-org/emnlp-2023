Q: I just finished my work and want to consider submiting it to EMNLP. Shall I submit it to ARR in the Jun cycle or directly to the conference?
{: .question}
A: You can choose either mode. However, if you choose to submit to ARR, and cannot get meta review by August 22, then you might risk not being able to commit to EMNLP. However, given that there is more than 2months before the deadline, it is likely that you will get your reviews by then!
{: .answer}

Q: Can I submit my paper back to ARR after being rejected from EMNLP?
{: .question}
A: A paper may not be simultaneously under review through ARR and EMNLP 2023. In addition, a paper that has received reviews through ARR and then separately receives reviews from EMNLP will not be eligible for resubmission to ARR, per [ARR's rules](https://aclrollingreview.org/organizers).
{: .answer}

Q: Do I have to submit my abstract to OpenReview if I commit from ARR?
{: .question}
A: No you do not have to. Just commit directly after Jun 23. We will make the submission page ready after the direct submission deadline.
{: .answer}

Q: Why does my draft not pass the formality test by using the standard conference template and ACL Pubcheck?
{: .question}
A: For using the verification script, one should *not* use the review mode.
{: .answer}

Q: If I commit from ARR, what is the page limit of my rebuttal file?
{: .question}
A: We require that the rebuttal file does not exceed one page using the standard template.
{: .answer}

Q: I am a reviewer and I want to reduce my review load / change my assigned submissions/ tell my unavailability dates.
{: .question}
A: Kindly contact your senior area chairs for taking necessary actions. For reduced load, you may decline the original invitation, which will take you to reduced load options.
{: .answer}

Q: I forgot to add Limitations to my submission, can you add this?
{: .question}
A: Sorry we have decided that all submissions without Limitations will be desk rejected
{: .answer}

Q: I want to commit my ARR submission to EMNLP, and cannot find the submission link.
{: .question}
A: This will be available soon.
{: .answer}

Q: Can I upload a modified version of our ARR submission?
{: .question}
A: No -- we will use the original version and original reviews, since there will be no separate reviewing process for ARR submissions.
{: .answer}

Q: The PDF file for ARR submission should contain the full paper or just the limiation and rebuttal sections?
{: .question}
A: It should only contain the limitation and rebuttal sections.
{: .answer}

Q: Do I have additional space for addressing reviewer comments in my final version?
{: .question}
A: When working on the camera-ready version, you have an extra page of content (total of 9 pages for long papers and 5 pages for short).
{: .answer}

Q: My paper is accepted! Can I put my accepted papers to arXiv?
{: .question}
A: Yes you can, but we suggest that you address the reviewer suggestions before doing that.
{: .answer}

Q: Why do I not receive additional comments or meta-review for my ARR submission?
{: .question}
A: The senior area chairs made selection of ARR submissions into the EMNLP conference by directly reading the reviews and meta-reviews from ARR, and then deciding a ranking of all submissions.
{: .answer}

Q: My paper is accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2022, and I wonder if it is eligible for presentation at the main conference?
{: .question}
A: Findings are not accommodated for presentation at the main conference. For more information, you can check https://2020.emnlp.org/blog/2020-04-19-findings-of-emnlp.

## Dual Submissions

Can I submit my work to another conference or submit work that is currently under review elsewhere (e.g. at EACL)?
{: .question}
NAACL-HLT 2021 will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission. This policy covers all refereed and archival conferences and workshops (including ACL workshops). For example, a paper under review at an EACL workshop cannot be dual-submitted to NAACL-HLT 2021. In addition, we will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly (>25%) in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Papers may not be submitted elsewhere during the NAACL-HLT 2021 review period. Authors submitting more than one paper to NAACL-HLT 2021 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.
{: .answer}

Can I submit papers that have appeared in non-archival workshops?
{: .question}
Yes, you can submit as long as the paper has not previously appeared in print.
{: .answer}

## Anonymity/Non-Archival

Is it OK to withdraw my paper from ICLR 2021 and submit to NAACL?
{: .question}
If a non-anonymous version of the paper was made publicly available before the NAACL 2021 anonymity period (on or before Oct 23), it is OK to withdraw from ICLR and submit to NAACL. However, if de-anonymization on withdrawal results in the paper being de-anonymized for the first time,  the paper would violate the NAACL 2021 anonymity policies.
{: .answer}

Is it OK to talk about my work (e.g. at a workshop) during the anonymity period?
{: .question}
Yes, you can talk in small venues about your work, but be careful not to publish a non-anonymized draft of the work and please do not publicize it widely (e.g. on social media).
{: .answer}

## Tracks

If I want to submit a paper related to the peer review process or some other "meta" topic, what is the correct track? For ACL 2020 there was the "theme track", but we need a consistent space for reflections, not limited to conference themes.
{: .question}
We've added a special theme track titled New Challenges in NLP: Tasks, Methods, Positions. If your paper fits this theme, please consider submitting there.
{: .answer}

## Reviewing

Is there a requirement that authors should also review for the conference?
{: .question}
Although it is much appreciated, it is not a requirement for authors to serve as reviewers for NAACL 2021. Regardless of that, you should still fill out your Softconf profile (with semantic scholar info) in order to allow us to properly handle conflicts of interest (COIs).
{: .answer}

How to handle papers for which you have seen the de-anonymized preprint and thus know who the authors are?
{: .question}
Try to be as unbiased as you can, but please continue with the review. This is allowed within the anonymity rules, as long as the paper was posted online one month in advance of the deadline. 
{: .answer}

## Template/Formatting

It says "authors will get extra space after the 8th page (4th page for short papers) for an ethics/broader impact statement." Does this mean that it's not counted in the total page limit?
{: .question}
No, the ethics/broader impact statement is not counted in the total page limit. Softconf initially had a bug that prevented lengthier submissions, but this has been fixed. Note that, due to this change, softconf no longer has automated checks for paper length, so be careful that the main content doesn’t go beyond the allowed pages count! 
{: .answer}

Which LaTeX template should be used?
{: .question}
[The style files are available here](https://2021.naacl.org/calls/style-and-formatting/).
{: .answer}

## Ethics Committee

See also: [Ethics FAQ](/ethics/faq/)

Could you provide more information on how the committee members would be chosen so that the committee will reflect diversity of ethical viewpoints (both geographical and cultural)?
{: .question}
We are recruiting people we know have engaged with these issues in their work and asking for recommendations for areas of the world not yet well represented on the committee. If you have suggestions, please email [Emily Bender](http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/contacting-me.html).
{: .answer}

## Virtual Attendance

Would I be able to present my paper virtually at the main conference and the workshops? Would I be able to participate in the conference virtually?
{: .question}
Yes, while we are still finalizing the format of the conference, all participants will have the option to attend virtually.
