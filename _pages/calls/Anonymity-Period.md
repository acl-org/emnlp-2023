The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month before the submission deadline (starting May 24, 2022) up to the date when your paper is accepted or rejected (Oct 6, 2022). Papers that are withdrawn during this period will no longer be subject to these rules.

- You **may not** make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. Versions of the paper include papers having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length.
- If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the programme chairs that a non-anonymized version exists.
- You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.
- You may make an anonymized version of your paper available (for example, on OpenReview), even during the anonymity period.
- For arXiv submissions, May 24, 2022 11:59pm UTC-12h (anywhere on earth) is the latest time the paper can be uploaded.
