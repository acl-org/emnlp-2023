All accepted papers must be presented at the conference—either on-line or in-person—in order to appear in the proceedings.  Authors of papers accepted for presentation at EMNLP 2022 must notify the program chairs by the camera-ready deadline if they wish to withdraw the paper.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP 2022 by the early registration deadline.

More information can be found in the Committee blog. If you have questions that are not answered there, please email the program co-chairs at emnlp2022pcs@gmail.com.
