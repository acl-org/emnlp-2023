<!--  Guidebooks and conversations with colleagues offer many suggestions for polite and appropriate behavior in Abu Dhabi. For example, learn a selection of Arabic phrases and use them when greeting new people.

When you are seated, make sure the sole of your foot is not pointing directly at anyone, as this would be insulting. Use your right hand to offer an item to another person or to receive items. For example, offer your business card with your right hand; you can receive one with both hands. The business week is Monday through Friday. -->
