The NLP research community, in academia and industry, is no exception to this. At the same time, changes in how we handle remote life -- both for conferences and day-to-day research and teaching -- along with adaptations that we have made individually, can impact our field for the better. In this panel, we talk with women NLP researchers at various stages of career growth about what challenges they have faced, how they have adapted, and what lessons we can take moving forward to create a more inclusive and accessible research community around the world.
