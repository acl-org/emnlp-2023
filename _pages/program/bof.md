# Welcome to Birds-of-a-Feather and Affinity Group Meetings

At EMNLP 2023, we continue the tradition of conducting birds-of-a-feather (or BoF) and Affinity Group Meeting sessions to help newbie researchers get in touch with other people working in the same areas. Here's a quick primer for people who havenâ€™t attended such sessions before!

# What do we hope to accomplish with BoF and Affinity Group Meeting sessions?

<ul>
<li>We want to provide junior researchers/people attending a CL conference for the first time with a platform to discuss ideas and issues with other researchers in their areas of interest. This can be a good avenue for junior researchers to get feedback on ongoing ideas, learn about relevant ongoing projects at other groups/universities, and develop a broader understanding of their field of interest.</li>

<li>We want to facilitate more exchange of research ideas and enable collaborative discussions.</li>
</ul>

# How are BoF and Affinity Group Meeting sessions structured?

<ul>
<li>All BoF and Affinity Group Meeting sessions are in-person only.</li>
<li>Each meetup will be led by the session chair(s).</li>
<li>Anyone who wants to attend can join; prior signup is unnecessary.</li>
</ul>

# When are the BoF and Affinity Group meeting sessions happening?
